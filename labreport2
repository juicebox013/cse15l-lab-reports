# CSE15L Lab Report 2 by Justin Nguyen

This week, students were tasked with the creation and implementation of a String Server in which takes in a String
and prints it on the local website. If we want to add another String, it will print on a new line on the website.

## Part 1 - creating the String Server

Using the labs as a reference, I created the String Server using the wavelet folder. I created a new file called 
`StringServer.java` and created two classes: the `Handler class` and the `StringServer class`. Once I finished with
the code, it looked like this:

## Part 2 - Identifying and fixing bugs

From the lab from week 3, students were tasked with indentifying bugs from a code and reporting the failure inducing
test, the symptoms, and what was changed in order to fix it. An example of this can be seen in the example below:

From the ArrayExamples file, the method `reversed` contained an error. The original code looked like:

```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
}
```

When testing the method using a JUnit test,
it resulted in an error message that looks like:

The failure inducing input was `{1, 2, 3}` and the symptom was `{0, 0, 0}`

This happened because the code was creating a new array in order to pass the values of the originial array through it, 
however, the code was instead updating the original array with values from the new Array, which was empty. Consequently,
the new array was changed to become full of zeros and was returned. 

In order to fix this error, we should change the code to look like this:

```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
}
```
Now, the code is updating the values of the newArray by using values from the original array.
